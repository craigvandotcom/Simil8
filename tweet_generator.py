def generate_tweet_variations(text: str, num_variations: int = 6) -> List[str]:
    prompt = f"""
    
    Transform the following text into {num_variations} diverse tweet versions:

    Text: "{text}"
    
    Instructions:
    - Create exactly {num_variations} tweet versions, each expanding on the ideas in the given text, offering additional context, or relating it to broader concepts.
    - Craft each tweet to add value by educating or inspiring action.
    - Keep each tweet within the 280-character limit.
    - Authenticity resonates with audiences. Avoid overly promotional language; be genuine.
    - Use active voice to make your tweets more dynamic and direct, increasing engagement.
    - Personalize tweets (e.g., using "you" and "your") to make them more relatable and engaging.
    - Incorporate engaging elements such as statistics or thought-provoking statements.
    - Maintain a consistent tone across all tweets that align with the target audience (professional).
    - DO NOT include any hashtags.
    - DO NOT ask rhetorical questions. Only ask questions that are intended to actually invite engagement.
    
    Specific goals for each tweet variation:
    1. Very similar to the original text, but improved for tweeting
    2. Best possible rephrasing for maximum engagement
    3. If we regard the input text as wisdom, focus on the risks of not implementing this wisdom
    4. If we regard the input text as wisdom, focus on the benefits of implementing this wisdom
    5. If we regard the input text as wisdom, focus on the practical steps to implement this wisdom (use a listicle where suitable)
    6. If we regard the input text as wisdom, focus on inspiring the reader to take action
    
    The ultimate goal is to add maximum value, educate, and inspire.
    
    Output Format:
    Provide the tweets as a valid JSON array of strings, like this:
    ["Tweet 1 content", "Tweet 2 content", "Tweet 3 content", ...]
    
    Ensure that each tweet is a complete, self-contained string within the array.
