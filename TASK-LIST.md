V00
- [x] 15min task to fetch highlights and create tweets

URGENT:
- [x] !!! readwise fetch not happenin
- [x] fetch from last highlight timestamp to correct for gaps
- [x] two threads bein made for each discord-tweet flow

V01: personal posts
- [x] Discord text to tweet flow
  - [x] preserve original text in first tweet
- [ ] Discord text to thread flow
- [ ] setup configuration optionality: # tweets / # threads
- [ ] improve tweet prompt (same/better/best/different, problem/benefits/solution)


- [ ] plan project overview w. AI: describe goal and journey - ask how to approach with sound python software engineering practices
- [ ] figure out versioning

V02: published 'notes'
- [ ] fetch published posts (Typefully or X)
- [ ] store in weekly markdown notes

V.03 notes 2 newsletters
- [ ] transform weekly notes into a newsletter
- [ ] publish two/three draft newsletter options to Beehive

V.04: UI to replace Discord
- [ ] log in
- [ ] 'send' text bottom bar bubble

V.05: UI notes, files, folders
- [ ] markdown weekly notes main window
- [ ] left sidebar files/folders

V0.1: 
- [ ] highlights, notes -> weekly notes
- [ ] tweets/threads/newsletters usable for me personally
- [ ] ??? simple login and input to replace Discord

Future
- V1 UI:
    - login
    - OpenAI token (unless freemium? Llamma 408B)
    - Typefully token

BUGS:
- two threads of tweet options being created (instead of one)
