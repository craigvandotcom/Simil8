# Project Plan: AI-Assisted Writing Environment

## 1. Backend Core Setup
- [x] Set up the Flask application structure
- [x] Implement basic configuration and environment variable handling
- [x] Create the main application entry point
- [x] Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms
- [x] Implement a second Discord channel for a basic thread prompt
- [x] Rename DISCORD_THREAD_CHANNEL_ID to DISCORD_WIF_THREAD_CHANNEL_ID
- [x] triple Readwise thread draft being created
- [ ] pytest not working properly - setup pytest to test each feature (APIs, actions)
- [x] remove num_variations
- [ ] add tweet variation plus general suggestion - make personal, about me (when I, because I, etc.)
- [ ] change readwise drafts to more # tweet variations

## Personal Features
- [x] setup second X/Typefully account: Practical/Pragmatic Impact
- [ ] classify incoming text: 9 domains
  - [ ] if this domain, then use that Typefully credential for draft
- [ ] fetch published posts from Typefully or X and add to domain-specific notes
  - [ ] if this domain, store published post in this note

### More flows:
- [ ] add image suggestions per tweet for tweets & threads to add to drafts
- [ ] add thread flows:
  - [ ] listicle of most actionable high-value tips
  - [ ] listicle of most interesting facts

## 2. Replit Database Integration
- [ ] Implement functions for CRUD operations using Replit's database
- [ ] Create a data model for storing markdown files and user data

- [ ] Conduct code reviews and refactoring sessions

## 3. Authentication System
- [ ] Implement user registration and login functionality
- [ ] Set up session management
- [ ] Create protected routes for authenticated users
- [ ] Implement security best practices (e.g., input validation, CSRF protection, secure headers)
- [ ] Conduct code reviews and refactoring sessions

## 4. Markdown File Management API
- [ ] Develop API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting markdown files
- [ ] Implement file listing and searching functionality
- [ ] Implement user quotas to prevent resource overuse

## 5. Frontend Basic Structure
- [ ] Set up the HTML structure for the application
- [ ] Implement basic CSS styling
- [ ] Create the layout for desktop and mobile views
- [ ] Implement a fully responsive design, testing on various devices and screen sizes
- [ ] Incorporate accessibility features for users with disabilities

## 6. Markdown Editor Component
- [ ] Implement a markdown editor in the central pane
- [ ] Add syntax highlighting for markdown
- [ ] Implement real-time preview functionality (if desired)

## 7. File Explorer Component
- [ ] Create the left sidebar file explorer
- [ ] Implement file navigation and selection
- [ ] Add file creation and deletion functionality in the UI

## 8. Text Input and AI Integration
- [ ] Implement the bottom text input bar
- [ ] Set up the connection to the AI service (e.g., OpenAI or Anthropic)
- [ ] Develop the logic for sending text to the AI and receiving responses

## 9. Right Pane AI Interaction
- [ ] Design and implement the AI chat interface in the right pane
- [ ] Create functionality to use the current file or file explorer as context for AI interactions

## 10. User Settings and Customization
- [ ] Implement user-specific settings (e.g., theme preferences, AI model selection)
- [ ] Create a settings interface for users to customize their experience

## 11. Export and Backup Functionality
- [ ] Implement functionality to export individual markdown files
- [ ] Create a feature to export all user files as a zip archive
- [ ] Develop a backup system for user data

## 12. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Implement frontend asset optimization
- [ ] Develop caching strategies
- [ ] Ensure efficient handling of multiple simultaneous connections

## 13. User Onboarding
- [ ] Develop tutorials or guided tours for new users

## 14. Analytics and Monitoring
- [ ] Set up analytics tools to track usage
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring for the production environment

## 15. Legal and Compliance
- [ ] Develop privacy policy and terms of service
- [ ] Ensure GDPR compliance if applicable

## 16. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Write unit tests for backend functionality
- [ ] Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Perform thorough testing of the frontend components
- [ ] Test the application's performance under various user loads

## 17. Documentation and Deployment
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation for the application
- [ ] Prepare the application for deployment on Replit
- [ ] Set up a robust CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Additional Considerations

- [ ] Set up Git for version control and establish collaboration processes
- [ ] Conduct regular code reviews and refactoring sessions
- [ ] Gather and incorporate user feedback throughout development
- [ ] Regularly review and adjust the project plan as needed

## Comments and Suggestions:

This step-by-step breakdown provides a structured approach to developing your project. Here are some additional tips to help you progress smoothly:

Iterative Development: After completing each step, take time to test thoroughly and refine if necessary before moving to the next step.

Version Control: Make frequent, small commits. This will help you track your progress and roll back if needed.

Testing: Implement testing early. Even simple console.log statements can help you catch issues early.

Documentation: Keep notes on your implementation decisions and any challenges you face. This will be invaluable if you need to revisit parts of the code later.

Flexible Planning: While this plan provides a structured approach, be prepared to adjust it as you go. You might find that some steps are easier or harder than anticipated, or that you need to add additional steps.

Regular Reviews: At the end of each phase, take time to review your progress. This is a good time to refactor code if needed and ensure you're still aligned with your overall project goals.

Incremental Feature Addition: Start with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and add features incrementally. This approach allows you to have a working product at each stage of development.

User Feedback: If possible, get feedback from potential users early and often. This can help guide your development priorities.

1. **Version Control and Collaboration**: Set up Git for version control and establish collaboration processes if working in a team.
